The PCRE library is used by KDE\'s Konqueror browser.';

testo[a++]='perl (Practical Extraction and Report Language)\n\
Larry Wall\'s "Practical Extraction and Report Language". Perl is a\n\
language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, extracting\n\
information from those text files, and printing reports based on that\n\
information. It\'s also a good language for many system management\n\
tasks. The language is intended to be practical (easy to use,\n\
efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).\n\
