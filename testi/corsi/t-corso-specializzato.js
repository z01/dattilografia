testo[a++]="Once upon a time, a good many years ago, there\r\nwas a traveller and he set out upon a journey. It\r\nwas a magic journey, and was to seem very long\r\nwhen he began it, and very short when he got half\r\nway through. He travelled along a rather dark\r\npath for some little time, without meeting\r\nanything, until at last he came to a beautiful\r\nchild. So he said to the child, \"What do you do\r\nhere?\" And the child said, \"I am always at play.\r\nCome and play with me!\"";
testo[a++]="So, he played with that child, the whole day\r\nlong, and they were very merry. The sky was so\r\nblue, the sun was so bright, the water was so\r\nsparkling, the leaves were so green, the flowers\r\nwere so lovely, and they heard such singing-birds\r\nand saw so many butteries, that everything was\r\nbeautiful. This was in fine weather. When it\r\nrained, they loved to watch the falling drops,\r\nand to smell the fresh scents. When it blew, it\r\nwas delightful to listen to the wind, and fancy\r\nwhat";
testo[a++]="it said, as it came rushing from its home-- where\r\nwas that, they wondered!--whistling and howling,\r\ndriving the clouds before it, bending the trees,\r\nrumbling in the chimneys, shaking the house, and\r\nmaking the sea roar in fury. But, when it snowed,\r\nthat was best of all; for, they liked nothing so\r\nwell as to look up at the white flakes falling\r\nfast and thick, like down from the breasts of\r\nmillions of white birds; and to see how smooth\r\nand deep the drift was;";
testo[a++]="They had plenty of the finest toys in the world,\r\nand the most astonishing picture-books: all about\r\nscimitars and slippers and turbans, and dwarfs and\r\ngiants and genii and fairies, and blue- beards and\r\nbean-stalks and riches and caverns and forests and\r\nValentines and Orsons: and all new and all true.";
testo[a++]="But, one day, of a sudden, the traveller lost the\r\nchild. He called to him over and over again, but\r\ngot no answer. So, he went upon his road, and\r\nwent on for a little while without meeting\r\nanything, until at last he came to a handsome\r\nboy. So, he said to the boy, \"What do you do\r\nhere?\" And the boy said, \"I am always learning.\r\nCome and learn with me.\" So he learned with that\r\nboy about Jupiter and Juno, and the Greeks and\r\nthe Romans, and I don't know what, and learned";
testo[a++]="more than I could tell--or he either, for he soon\r\nforgot a great deal of it. But, they were not\r\nalways learning; they had the merriest games that\r\never were played. They rowed upon the river in\r\nsummer, and skated on the ice in winter; they\r\nwere active afoot, and active on horseback; at\r\ncricket, and all games at ball; at prisoner's\r\nbase, hare and hounds, follow my leader, and more\r\nsports than I can think of; nobody could beat\r\nthem. They had holidays too, and Twelfth";
testo[a++]="cakes, and parties where they danced till\r\nmidnight, and real Theatres where they saw\r\npalaces of real gold and silver rise out of the\r\nreal earth, and saw all the wonders of the world\r\nat once. As to friends, they had such dear friends\r\nand so many of them, that I want the time to\r\nreckon them up. They were all young, like the\r\nhandsome boy, and were never to be strange to one\r\nanother all their lives through.";
testo[a++]="Still, one day, in the midst of all these\r\npleasures, the traveller lost the boy as he had\r\nlost the child, and, after calling to him in\r\nvain, went on upon his journey. So he went\r\non for a little while without seeing anything,\r\nuntil at last he came to a young man. So, he said\r\nto the young man, \"What do you do here?\" And the\r\nyoung man said, \"I am always in love. Come and\r\nlove with me.\"";
testo[a++]="So, he went away with that young man, and\r\npresently they came to one of the prettiest girls\r\nthat ever was seen--just like Fanny in the corner\r\nthere--and she had eyes like Fanny, and hair like\r\nFanny, and dimples like Fanny's, and she laughed\r\nand coloured just as Fanny does while I am\r\ntalking about her. So, the young man fell in love\r\ndirectly--just as Somebody I won't mention, the\r\nfirst time he came here, did with Fanny. Well! he\r\nwas teased sometimes--just as Somebody used to be";
testo[a++]="by Fanny; and they quarrelled sometimes--just as\r\nSomebody and Fanny used to quarrel; and they made\r\nit up, and sat in the dark, and wrote letters\r\nevery day, and never were happy asunder, and were\r\nalways looking out for one another and pretending\r\nnot to, and were engaged at Christmas-time, and\r\nsat close to one another by the fire, and were\r\ngoing to be married very soon--all exactly like\r\nSomebody I won't mention, and Fanny!";
testo[a++]="But, the traveller lost them one day, as he had\r\nlost the rest of his friends, and, after calling\r\nto them to come back, which they never did, went\r\non upon his journey. So, he went on for a little\r\nwhile without seeing anything, until at last he\r\ncame to a middle-aged gentleman. So, he said to\r\nthe gentleman, \"What are you doing here?\" And his\r\nanswer was, \"I am always busy. Come and be busy\r\nwith me!\"";
testo[a++]="So, he began to be very busy with that gentleman,\r\nand they went on through the wood together. The\r\nwhole journey was through a wood, only it had\r\nbeen open and green at first, like a wood in\r\nspring; and now began to be thick and dark, like\r\na wood in summer; some of the little trees that\r\nhad come out earliest, were even turning brown.\r\nThe gentleman was not alone, but had a lady of\r\nabout the same age with him, who was his Wife;\r\nand they had children, who were with them too.";
testo[a++]="So, they all went on together through the wood,\r\ncutting down the trees, and making a path through\r\nthe branches and the fallen leaves, and carrying\r\nburdens, and working hard. Sometimes, they came\r\nto a long green avenue that opened into deeper\r\nwoods. Then they would hear a very little,\r\ndistant voice crying, \"Father, father, I am\r\nanother child! Stop for me!\" And presently they\r\nwould see a very little figure, growing larger as\r\nit came along, running to join them. When";
testo[a++]="it came up, they all crowded round it, and kissed\r\nand welcomed it; and then they all went on\r\ntogether. Sometimes, they came to several avenues\r\nat once, and then they all stood still, and one\r\nof the children said, \"Father, I am going to\r\nsea,\" and another said, \"Father, I am going to\r\nIndia,\" and another, \"Father, I am going to seek\r\nmy fortune where I can,\" and another, \"Father, I\r\nam going to Heaven!\" So, with many tears at\r\nparting, they went, solitary, down";
testo[a++]="those avenues, each child upon its way; and the\r\nchild who went to Heaven, rose into the golden\r\nair and vanished. Whenever these partings\r\nhappened, the traveller looked at the gentleman,\r\nand saw him glance up at the sky above the trees,\r\nwhere the day was beginning to decline, and the\r\nsunset to come on. He saw, too, that his hair was\r\nturning grey. But, they never could rest long,\r\nfor they had their journey to perform, and it was\r\nnecessary for them to be always busy.";
testo[a++]="At last, there had been so many partings that\r\nthere were no children left, and only the\r\ntraveller, the gentleman, and the lady, went upon\r\ntheir way in company. And now the wood was\r\nyellow; and now brown; and the leaves, even of\r\nthe forest trees, began to fall. So, they came to\r\nan avenue that was darker than the rest, and\r\nwere pressing forward on their journey without\r\nlooking down it when the lady stopped.";
testo[a++]="\"My husband,\" said the lady. \"I am called.\" They\r\nlistened, and they heard a voice a long way down\r\nthe avenue, say, \"Mother, mother!\" It was the\r\nvoice of the first child who had said, \"I am going\r\nto Heaven!\" and the father said, \"I pray not yet.\r\nThe sunset is very near. I pray not yet!\"";
testo[a++]="But, the voice cried, \"Mother, mother!\" without\r\nminding him, though his hair was now quite white,\r\nand tears were on his face. Then, the mother, who\r\nwas already drawn into the shade of the dark\r\navenue and moving away with her arms still round\r\nhis neck, kissed him, and said, \"My dearest, I am\r\nsummoned, and I go!\" And she was gone. And the\r\ntraveller and he were left alone together.";
testo[a++]="And they went on and on together, until they\r\ncame to very near the end of the wood: so near,\r\nthat they could see the sunset shining red\r\nbefore them through the trees. Yet, once more,\r\nwhile he broke his way among the branches, the\r\ntraveller lost his friend. He called and called,\r\nbut there was no reply, and when he passed out\r\nof the wood, and saw the peaceful sun going down\r\nupon a wide purple prospect, he came to an old\r\nman sitting on a fallen tree. So, he said";
testo[a++]="to the old man, \"What do you do here?\" And the\r\nold man said with a calm smile, \"I am always\r\nremembering. Come and remember with me!\" So the\r\ntraveller sat down by the side of that old man,\r\nface to face with the serene sunset; and all his\r\nfriends came softly back and stood around him.\r\nThe beautiful child, the handsome boy, the young\r\nman in love, the father, mother, and children:\r\nevery one of them was there, and he had lost";
testo[a++]="nothing. So, he loved them all, and was kind and\r\nforbearing with them all, and was always pleased\r\nto watch them all, and they all honoured and loved\r\nhim. And I think the traveller must be yourself,\r\ndear Grandfather, because this what you do to us,\r\nand what we do to you.";
testo[a++]="Thirty-five years ago I was out prospecting on\r\nthe Stanislaus, tramping all day long with pick\r\nand pan and horn, and washing a hatful of dirt\r\nhere and there, always expecting to make a rich\r\nstrike, and never doing it. It was a lovely\r\nreason, woodsy, balmy, delicious, and had once\r\nbeen populous, long years before, but now the\r\npeople had vanished and the charming paradise was\r\na solitude. They went away when the surface\r\ndiggings gave out. In one place, where a busy\r\nlittle city with";

This was down toward Tuttletown.\r\nIn the country neighborhood thereabouts, along\r\nthe dusty roads, one found at intervals the\r\nprettiest little cottage homes, snug and cozy,\r\nand so cobwebbed with vines snowed thick with\r\nroses that the doors and windows were wholly\r\nhidden from sight--sign";

Now\r\nand then, half an hour apart, one came across\r\nsolitary log cabins of the earliest mining\r\ndays, built by the first gold-miners, the\r\npredecessors of the cottage-builders. In some few\r\ncases these cabins were still occupied; and when\r\nthis was so, you could depend upon it that the\r\noccupant was the very pioneer who had built the";

testo[a++]="secret thoughts were made all of regrets and\r\nlongings--regrets for their wasted lives, and\r\nlongings to be out of the struggle and done with\r\nit all. It was a lonesome land! Not a sound in\r\nall those peaceful expanses of grass and woods\r\nbut the drowsy hum of insects; no glimpse of man\r\nor beast; nothing to keep up your spirits and\r\nmake you glad to be alive. And so, at last, in\r\nthe early part of the afternoon, when I caught\r\nsight of a human";

This\r\nperson was a man about forty-five years old, and\r\nhe was standing at the gate of one of those cozy\r\nlittle rose-clad cottages of the sort already\r\nreferred to. However, this one hadn't a deserted\r\nlook; it had the look of being lived in and\r\npetted and cared for and looked after; and so had\r\nits front yard, which was a garden of flowers,\r\nabundant, gay, and flourishing. I was invited in,\r\nof course, and required to make myself at home--";

It was\r\ndelightful to be in such a place, after long\r\nweeks of daily and nightly familiarity with\r\nminers' cabins--with all which this implies\r\nof dirt floor, never-made beds, tin plates and\r\ncups, bacon and beans and black coffee, and\r\nnothing of ornament but war pictures from the\r\nEastern illustrated papers tacked to the\r\nlog walls.

I could not have believed that\r\na rag carpet could feast me so, and so content\r\nme; or that there could be such solace to the\r\nsoul in wall-paper and framed lithographs, and\r\nbright-colored tidies and lamp-mats, and Windsor\r\nchairs";

The delight\r\nthat was in my heart showed in my face, and the\r\nman saw it and was pleased; saw it so plainly\r\nthat he answered it as if it had been spoken.";
testo[a++]="\"All her work,\" he said, caressingly; \"she did it\r\nall herself-- every bit,\" and he took the room in\r\nwith a glance which was full of affectionate\r\nworship. One of those soft Japanese fabrics with\r\nwhich women drape with careful negligence the\r\nupper part of a picture-frame was out of\r\nadjustment. He noticed it, and rearranged it with\r\ncautious pains, stepping back several times to\r\ngauge the effect before he got it to suit him.\r\nThen he gave it a light finishing";

You can't tell just what it lacks, but\r\nit does lack something until you've done\r\nthat--you can see it yourself after it's\r\ndone, but that is all you know; you can't find\r\nout the law of it. It's like the finishing pats a\r\nmother gives the child's hair after she's got it\r\ncombed and brushed, I reckon.

So my face spoke\r\nagain, and he answered with gratified words: \"All\r\nher work; she did it all herself--every bit.\r\nNothing here that hasn't felt the touch of her\r\nhand.

I knew it perfectly,\r\nand I knew he was trying to help me by furtive\r\nindications with his eye, so I tried hard to";

I failed several times, as I could see out of\r\nthe corner of my eye without being told; but at\r\nlast I knew I must be looking straight at the\r\nthing--knew it from the pleasure issuing in\r\ninvisible waves from him. He broke into a happy\r\nlaugh, and rubbed his hands together, and cried\r\nout:";

Presently he was\r\nback, with the picture case in his hand, and he\r\nheld it open before me and said: \"There, now,\r\ntell her to her face you could have stayed to\r\nsee her, and you wouldn't.\" That second glimpse\r\nbroke down my good resolution. I would stay and\r\ntake the risk. That night we smoked the tranquil";

Toward nine the three miners said\r\nthat as they had brought their instruments they\r\nmight as well tune up, for the boys and girls\r\nwould soon be arriving now, and hungry for a\r\ngood, old-fashioned break-down.

testo[a++]="The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable\r\nincident, a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon,\r\nwhich doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to\r\nmention rumours which agitated the maritime\r\npopulation and excited the public mind, even in\r\nthe interior of continents, seafaring men were\r\nparticularly excited. Merchants, common sailors,\r\ncaptains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and\r\nAmerica, naval officers of all countries, and the\r\nGovernments of several States on the two";
testo[a++]="continents, were deeply interested in the matter.\r\nFor some time past vessels had been met by \"an\r\nenormous thing,\" a long object, spindle-shaped,\r\noccasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely\r\nlarger and more rapid in its movements than a\r\nwhale. The facts relating to this apparition\r\n(entered in various log-books) agreed in most\r\nrespects as to the shape of the object or\r\ncreature in question, the untiring rapidity of\r\nits movements, its surprising power of\r\nlocomotion, and the";
testo[a++]="peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it\r\nwas a whale, it surpassed in size all those\r\nhitherto classified in science. Taking into\r\nconsideration the mean of observations made at\r\ndivers times-- rejecting the timid estimate of\r\nthose who assigned to this object a length of two\r\nhundred feet, equally with the exaggerated\r\nopinions which set it down as a mile in\r\nwidth and three in length--we might fairly\r\nconclude that this mysterious being surpassed\r\ngreatly all dimensions admitted by";
testo[a++]="the learned ones of the day, if it existed at\r\nall. And that it did exist was an undeniable\r\nfact; and, with that tendency which disposes the\r\nhuman mind in favour of the marvellous, we can\r\nunderstand the excitement produced in the entire\r\nworld by this supernatural apparition. As to\r\nclassing it in the list of fables, the idea was\r\nout of the question. On the 20th of July, 1866,\r\nthe steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta\r\nand Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met\r\nthis";
testo[a++]="moving mass five miles off the east coast of\r\nAustralia. Captain Baker thought at first that he\r\nwas in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he\r\neven prepared to determine its exact position\r\nwhen two columns of water, projected by the\r\nmysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a\r\nhundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now,\r\nunless the sandbank had been submitted to the\r\nintermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor\r\nHigginson had to do neither more nor less than\r\nwith";
testo[a++]="an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw\r\nup from its blow-holes columns of water mixed\r\nwith air and vapour. Similar facts were observed\r\non the 23rd of July in the same year, in the\r\nPacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India\r\nand Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But this\r\nextraordinary creature could transport itself\r\nfrom one place to another with surprising\r\nvelocity; as, in an interval of three days,\r\nthe Governor Higginson and the Columbus had\r\nobserved it at";

In these simultaneous";

Now the largest whales, those which\r\nfrequent those parts of the sea round the\r\nAleutian, Kulammak, and Umgullich islands, have\r\nnever exceeded the length of sixty yards, if\r\nthey attain that.";
testo[a++]="In every place of great resort the monster was\r\nthe fashion. They sang of it in the cafes,\r\nridiculed it in the papers, and represented it on\r\nthe stage.

The officers of\r\nthe quarter-deck hurried to the after-part of the\r\nvessel. They examined the sea with the most\r\ncareful attention.

This fact, so grave in\r\nitself, might perhaps have been forgotten like\r\nmany others if, three weeks after, it had not\r\nbeen re-enacted under similar circumstances. But,\r\nthanks to the nationality of the victim of the\r\nshock, thanks to the reputation of the company to";

The 13th of April,\r\n1867, the sea being beautiful, the breeze\r\nfavourable, the Scotia, of the Cunard Company's\r\nline, found herself in 15@ 12' long. and 45@ 37'\r\nlat. She was going at the speed of thirteen knots\r\nand a half. At seventeen minutes past four in the\r\nafternoon, whilst the passengers were assembled\r\nat lunch in the great saloon, a slight shock was\r\nfelt on the hull of the Scotia, on her";

The shock had been\r\nso slight that no one had been alarmed, had it\r\nnot been for the shouts of the carpenter's watch,\r\nwho rushed on to the bridge, exclaiming, \"We are\r\nsinking! we are sinking!\" At first the passengers\r\nwere much frightened, but Captain Anderson\r\nhastened to reassure them. The danger could not\r\nbe imminent.";

Fortunately this compartment did\r\nnot hold the boilers, or the fires would have\r\nbeen immediately extinguished. Captain Anderson\r\nordered the engines to be";

Some minutes\r\nafterwards they discovered the existence of a\r\nlarge hole, two yards in diameter, in the ship's\r\nbottom. Such a leak could not be stopped; and the\r\nScotia, her paddles half submerged, was obliged\r\nto continue her course. She was then three\r\nhundred miles from Cape Clear, and, after three\r\ndays' delay, which caused great uneasiness in\r\nLiverpool, she entered the basin";

The broken place in the\r\niron plates was so perfectly defined that it\r\ncould not have been more neatly done by a punch.\r\nIt was clear, then, that the instrument producing\r\nthe perforation was not of a common stamp and,\r\nafter having been driven with prodigious\r\nstrength,";

In virtue of my office as Assistant\r\nProfessor in the Museum of Natural History in\r\nParis, the French Government had attached me to\r\nthat expedition. After six months in Nebraska, I\r\narrived in New York towards the end of March,\r\nladen with a precious collection. My departure\r\nfor France was fixed for the first";
testo[a++]="days in May. Meanwhile I was occupying myself in\r\nclassifying my mineralogical, botanical, and\r\nzoological riches, when the accident happened to\r\nthe Scotia. I was perfectly up in the subject\r\nwhich was the question of the day. How could I be\r\notherwise? I had read and reread all the American\r\nand European papers without being any nearer a\r\nconclusion. This mystery puzzled me. Under the\r\nimpossibility of forming an opinion, I jumped\r\nfrom one extreme to the other. That there really\r\nwas";
testo[a++]="something could not be doubted, and the\r\nincredulous were invited to put their finger on\r\nthe wound of the Scotia. On my arrival at New\r\nYork the question was at its height. The theory\r\nof the floating island, and the unapproachable\r\nsandbank, supported by minds little competent to\r\nform a judgment, was abandoned. And, indeed,\r\nunless this shoal had a machine in its stomach,\r\nhow could it change its position with such\r\nastonishing rapidity?";
testo[a++]="From the same cause, the idea of a floating hull\r\nof an enormous wreck was given up. There remained,\r\nthen, only two possible solutions of the question,\r\nwhich created two distinct parties: on one side,\r\nthose who were for a monster of colossal strength;\r\non the other, those who were for a submarine\r\nvessel of enormous motive power.";

But how admit that\r\nthe construction of this submarine boat had\r\nescaped the public eye? For a private gentleman\r\nto keep the secret under such circumstances would\r\nbe very difficult, and for a State whose";

Upon my arrival in\r\nNew York several persons did me the honour of\r\nconsulting me on the phenomenon in question. I\r\nhad published in France a work in quarto, in two\r\nvolumes, entitled Mysteries of the Great\r\nSubmarine Grounds. This book, highly approved of\r\nin the learned world, gained for me a special\r\nreputation in this rather obscure branch of\r\nNatural History. My advice was asked. As long as\r\n";
testo[a++]="I could deny the reality of the fact, I confined\r\nmyself to a decided negative. But soon, finding\r\nmyself driven into a corner, I was obliged to\r\nexplain myself point by point. I discussed the\r\nquestion in all its forms, politically and\r\nscientifically; and I give here an extract from a\r\ncarefully-studied article which I published in the\r\nnumber of the 30th of April. It ran as follows:";
testo[a++]="\"After examining one by one the different\r\ntheories, rejecting all other suggestions, it\r\nbecomes necessary to admit the existence of a\r\nmarine animal of enormous power. The great depths\r\nof the ocean are entirely unknown to us.\r\nSoundings cannot reach them. What passes in those\r\nremote depths-- what beings live, or can live,\r\ntwelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of\r\nthe waters--what is the organisation of these\r\nanimals, we can scarcely conjecture.";
testo[a++]="However, the solution of the problem submitted to\r\nme may modify the form of the dilemma. Either we\r\ndo know all the varieties of beings which people\r\nour planet, or we do not. If we do not know them\r\nall--if Nature has still secrets in the deeps for\r\nus, nothing is more conformable to reason than\r\nto admit the existence of fishes, or cetaceans of\r\nother kinds, or even of new species, of an\r\norganisation formed to inhabit the strata\r\ninaccessible to soundings, and which an accident";
testo[a++]="of some sort has brought at long intervals to the\r\nupper level of the ocean. If, on the contrary, we\r\ndo know all living kinds, we must necessarily\r\nseek for the animal in question amongst those\r\nmarine beings already classed; and, in that case,\r\nI should be disposed to admit the existence of a\r\ngigantic narwhal. The common narwhal, or unicorn\r\nof the sea, often attains a length of sixty feet.\r\nIncrease its size fivefold or tenfold, give it\r\nstrength proportionate to its";
testo[a++]="size, lengthen its destructive weapons, and you\r\nobtain the animal required. It will have the\r\nproportions determined by the officers of the\r\nShannon, the instrument required by the\r\nperforation of the Scotia, and the power\r\nnecessary to pierce the hull of the steamer.\r\nIndeed, the narwhal is armed with a sort of ivory\r\nsword, a halberd, according to the expression\r\nof certain naturalists. The principal tusk has\r\nthe hardness of steel. Some of these tusks have\r\nbeen found buried in the";
testo[a++]="bodies of whales, which the unicorn always\r\nattacks with success. Others have been drawn out,\r\nnot without trouble, from the bottoms of ships,\r\nwhich they had pierced through and through, as a\r\ngimlet pierces a barrel. The Museum of the\r\nFaculty of Medicine of Paris possesses one of\r\nthese defensive weapons, two yards and a quarter\r\nin length, and fifteen inches in diameter at the\r\nbase.\"";
testo[a++]="\"Very well! suppose this weapon to be six times\r\nstronger and the animal ten times more powerful;\r\nlaunch it at the rate of twenty miles an hour,\r\nand you obtain a shock capable of producing the\r\ncatastrophe required. Until further information,\r\ntherefore, I shall maintain it to be a\r\nsea-unicorn of colossal dimensions, armed not\r\nwith a halberd, but with a real spur, as the\r\narmoured frigates, or the `rams' of war, whose\r\nmassiveness and motive power it would possess at\r\nthe";

Thus may this puzzling phenomenon be\r\nexplained, unless there be something over and\r\nabove all that one has ever conjectured, seen,\r\nperceived, or experienced; which is just within\r\nthe bounds of possibility.\" These last words were\r\ncowardly on my part; but, up to a certain point,\r\nI wished to shelter my dignity as professor, and\r\nnot give too much cause for laughter to the\r\nAmericans, who laugh well when they do laugh. I\r\nreserved for myself a way of escape. In effect,";
testo[a++]="however, I admitted the existence of the\r\n\"monster.\" My article was warmly discussed, which\r\nprocured it a high reputation. It rallied round\r\nit a certain number of partisans. The solution it\r\nproposed gave, at least, full liberty to the\r\nimagination. The human mind delights in grand\r\nconceptions of supernatural beings. And the sea\r\nis precisely their best vehicle, the only medium\r\nthrough which these giants (against which\r\nterrestrial animals, such as elephants or\r\nrhinoceroses,";
testo[a++]="are as nothing) can be produced or developed. The\r\nindustrial and commercial papers treated the\r\nquestion chiefly from this point of view. The\r\nShipping and Mercantile Gazette, the Lloyd's\r\nList, the Packet-Boat, and the Maritime and\r\nColonial Review, all papers devoted to insurance\r\ncompanies which threatened to raise their rates\r\nof premium, were unanimous on this point. Public\r\nopinion had been pronounced. The United States\r\nwere the first in the field; and in New York they\r\nmade";
testo[a++]="preparations for an expedition destined to pursue\r\nthis narwhal. A frigate of great speed, the\r\nAbraham Lincoln, was put in commission as soon as\r\npossible. The arsenals were opened to Commander\r\nFarragut, who hastened the arming of his frigate;\r\nbut, as it always happens, the moment it was\r\ndecided to pursue the monster, the monster did\r\nnot appear. For two months no one heard it spoken\r\nof. No ship met with it. It seemed as if this\r\nunicorn knew of the plots weaving around it.";
testo[a++]="It had been so much talked of, even through the\r\nAtlantic cable, that jesters pretended that this\r\nslender fly had stopped a telegram on its passage\r\nand was making the most of it.
