testo[a++]="Once upon a time, a good many years ago, there\nwas a traveller and he set out upon a journey. It\nwas a magic journey, and was to seem very long\nwhen he began it, and very short when he got half\nway through. He travelled along a rather dark\npath for some little time, without meeting\nanything, until at last he came to a beautiful\nchild. So he said to the child, \"What do you do\nhere?\" And the child said, \"I am always at play.\nCome and play with me!\"";
testo[a++]="So, he played with that child, the whole day\nlong, and they were very merry. The sky was so\nblue, the sun was so bright, the water was so\nsparkling, the leaves were so green, the flowers\nwere so lovely, and they heard such singing-birds\nand saw so many butteries, that everything was\nbeautiful. This was in fine weather. When it\nrained, they loved to watch the falling drops,\nand to smell the fresh scents. When it blew, it\nwas delightful to listen to the wind, and fancy\nwhat";
testo[a++]="it said, as it came rushing from its home-- where\nwas that, they wondered!--whistling and howling,\ndriving the clouds before it, bending the trees,\nrumbling in the chimneys, shaking the house, and\nmaking the sea roar in fury. But, when it snowed,\nthat was best of all; for, they liked nothing so\nwell as to look up at the white flakes falling\nfast and thick, like down from the breasts of\nmillions of white birds; and to see how smooth\nand deep the drift was;";
testo[a++]="They had plenty of the finest toys in the world,\nand the most astonishing picture-books: all about\nscimitars and slippers and turbans, and dwarfs and\ngiants and genii and fairies, and blue- beards and\nbean-stalks and riches and caverns and forests and\nValentines and Orsons: and all new and all true.";
testo[a++]="But, one day, of a sudden, the traveller lost the\nchild. He called to him over and over again, but\ngot no answer. So, he went upon his road, and\nwent on for a little while without meeting\nanything, until at last he came to a handsome\nboy. So, he said to the boy, \"What do you do\nhere?\" And the boy said, \"I am always learning.\nCome and learn with me.\" So he learned with that\nboy about Jupiter and Juno, and the Greeks and\nthe Romans, and I don't know what, and learned";
testo[a++]="more than I could tell--or he either, for he soon\nforgot a great deal of it. But, they were not\nalways learning; they had the merriest games that\never were played. They rowed upon the river in\nsummer, and skated on the ice in winter; they\nwere active afoot, and active on horseback; at\ncricket, and all games at ball; at prisoner's\nbase, hare and hounds, follow my leader, and more\nsports than I can think of; nobody could beat\nthem. They had holidays too, and Twelfth";
testo[a++]="cakes, and parties where they danced till\nmidnight, and real Theatres where they saw\npalaces of real gold and silver rise out of the\nreal earth, and saw all the wonders of the world\nat once. As to friends, they had such dear friends\nand so many of them, that I want the time to\nreckon them up. They were all young, like the\nhandsome boy, and were never to be strange to one\nanother all their lives through.";
testo[a++]="Still, one day, in the midst of all these\npleasures, the traveller lost the boy as he had\nlost the child, and, after calling to him in\nvain, went on upon his journey. So he went\non for a little while without seeing anything,\nuntil at last he came to a young man. So, he said\nto the young man, \"What do you do here?\" And the\nyoung man said, \"I am always in love. Come and\nlove with me.\"";
testo[a++]="So, he went away with that young man, and\npresently they came to one of the prettiest girls\nthat ever was seen--just like Fanny in the corner\nthere--and she had eyes like Fanny, and hair like\nFanny, and dimples like Fanny's, and she laughed\nand coloured just as Fanny does while I am\ntalking about her. So, the young man fell in love\ndirectly--just as Somebody I won't mention, the\nfirst time he came here, did with Fanny. Well! he\nwas teased sometimes--just as Somebody used to be";
testo[a++]="by Fanny; and they quarrelled sometimes--just as\nSomebody and Fanny used to quarrel; and they made\nit up, and sat in the dark, and wrote letters\nevery day, and never were happy asunder, and were\nalways looking out for one another and pretending\nnot to, and were engaged at Christmas-time, and\nsat close to one another by the fire, and were\ngoing to be married very soon--all exactly like\nSomebody I won't mention, and Fanny!";
testo[a++]="But, the traveller lost them one day, as he had\nlost the rest of his friends, and, after calling\nto them to come back, which they never did, went\non upon his journey. So, he went on for a little\nwhile without seeing anything, until at last he\ncame to a middle-aged gentleman. So, he said to\nthe gentleman, \"What are you doing here?\" And his\nanswer was, \"I am always busy. Come and be busy\nwith me!\"";
testo[a++]="So, he began to be very busy with that gentleman,\nand they went on through the wood together. The\nwhole journey was through a wood, only it had\nbeen open and green at first, like a wood in\nspring; and now began to be thick and dark, like\na wood in summer; some of the little trees that\nhad come out earliest, were even turning brown.\nThe gentleman was not alone, but had a lady of\nabout the same age with him, who was his Wife;\nand they had children, who were with them too.";
testo[a++]="So, they all went on together through the wood,\ncutting down the trees, and making a path through\nthe branches and the fallen leaves, and carrying\nburdens, and working hard. Sometimes, they came\nto a long green avenue that opened into deeper\nwoods. Then they would hear a very little,\ndistant voice crying, \"Father, father, I am\nanother child! Stop for me!\" And presently they\nwould see a very little figure, growing larger as\nit came along, running to join them. When";
testo[a++]="it came up, they all crowded round it, and kissed\nand welcomed it; and then they all went on\ntogether. Sometimes, they came to several avenues\nat once, and then they all stood still, and one\nof the children said, \"Father, I am going to\nsea,\" and another said, \"Father, I am going to\nIndia,\" and another, \"Father, I am going to seek\nmy fortune where I can,\" and another, \"Father, I\nam going to Heaven!\" So, with many tears at\nparting, they went, solitary, down";
testo[a++]="those avenues, each child upon its way; and the\nchild who went to Heaven, rose into the golden\nair and vanished. Whenever these partings\nhappened, the traveller looked at the gentleman,\nand saw him glance up at the sky above the trees,\nwhere the day was beginning to decline, and the\nsunset to come on. He saw, too, that his hair was\nturning grey. But, they never could rest long,\nfor they had their journey to perform, and it was\nnecessary for them to be always busy.";
testo[a++]="At last, there had been so many partings that\nthere were no children left, and only the\ntraveller, the gentleman, and the lady, went upon\ntheir way in company. And now the wood was\nyellow; and now brown; and the leaves, even of\nthe forest trees, began to fall. So, they came to\nan avenue that was darker than the rest, and\nwere pressing forward on their journey without\nlooking down it when the lady stopped.";
testo[a++]="\"My husband,\" said the lady. \"I am called.\" They\nlistened, and they heard a voice a long way down\nthe avenue, say, \"Mother, mother!\" It was the\nvoice of the first child who had said, \"I am going\nto Heaven!\" and the father said, \"I pray not yet.\nThe sunset is very near. I pray not yet!\"";
testo[a++]="But, the voice cried, \"Mother, mother!\" without\nminding him, though his hair was now quite white,\nand tears were on his face. Then, the mother, who\nwas already drawn into the shade of the dark\navenue and moving away with her arms still round\nhis neck, kissed him, and said, \"My dearest, I am\nsummoned, and I go!\" And she was gone. And the\ntraveller and he were left alone together.";
testo[a++]="And they went on and on together, until they\ncame to very near the end of the wood: so near,\nthat they could see the sunset shining red\nbefore them through the trees. Yet, once more,\nwhile he broke his way among the branches, the\ntraveller lost his friend. He called and called,\nbut there was no reply, and when he passed out\nof the wood, and saw the peaceful sun going down\nupon a wide purple prospect, he came to an old\nman sitting on a fallen tree. So, he said";
testo[a++]="to the old man, \"What do you do here?\" And the\nold man said with a calm smile, \"I am always\nremembering. Come and remember with me!\" So the\ntraveller sat down by the side of that old man,\nface to face with the serene sunset; and all his\nfriends came softly back and stood around him.\nThe beautiful child, the handsome boy, the young\nman in love, the father, mother, and children:\nevery one of them was there, and he had lost";
testo[a++]="nothing. So, he loved them all, and was kind and\nforbearing with them all, and was always pleased\nto watch them all, and they all honoured and loved\nhim. And I think the traveller must be yourself,\ndear Grandfather, because this what you do to us,\nand what we do to you.";
testo[a++]="Thirty-five years ago I was out prospecting on\nthe Stanislaus, tramping all day long with pick\nand pan and horn, and washing a hatful of dirt\nhere and there, always expecting to make a rich\nstrike, and never doing it. It was a lovely\nreason, woodsy, balmy, delicious, and had once\nbeen populous, long years before, but now the\npeople had vanished and the charming paradise was\na solitude. They went away when the surface\ndiggings gave out. In one place, where a busy\nlittle city with";
testo[a++]="banks and newspapers and fire companies and a\nmayor and aldermen had been, was nothing but a\nwide expanse of emerald turf, with not even the\nfaintest sign that human life had ever been\npresent there. This was down toward Tuttletown.\nIn the country neighborhood thereabouts, along\nthe dusty roads, one found at intervals the\nprettiest little cottage homes, snug and cozy,\nand so cobwebbed with vines snowed thick with\nroses that the doors and windows were wholly\nhidden from sight--sign";
testo[a++]="that these were deserted homes, forsaken years\nago by defeated and disappointed families who\ncould neither sell them nor give them away. Now\nand then, half an hour apart, one came across\nsolitary log cabins of the earliest mining\ndays, built by the first gold-miners, the\npredecessors of the cottage-builders. In some few\ncases these cabins were still occupied; and when\nthis was so, you could depend upon it that the\noccupant was the very pioneer who had built the";
testo[a++]="cabin; and you could depend on another thing,\ntoo--that he was there because he had once had\nhis opportunity to go home to the States rich,\nand had not done it; had rather lost his wealth,\nand had then in his humiliation resolved to sever\nall communication with his home relatives and\nfriends, and be to them thenceforth as one dead.\nRound about California in that day were scattered\na host of these living dead men-- pride-smitten\npoor fellows, grizzled and old at forty, whose";
testo[a++]="secret thoughts were made all of regrets and\nlongings--regrets for their wasted lives, and\nlongings to be out of the struggle and done with\nit all. It was a lonesome land! Not a sound in\nall those peaceful expanses of grass and woods\nbut the drowsy hum of insects; no glimpse of man\nor beast; nothing to keep up your spirits and\nmake you glad to be alive. And so, at last, in\nthe early part of the afternoon, when I caught\nsight of a human";
testo[a++]="creature, I felt a most grateful uplift. This\nperson was a man about forty-five years old, and\nhe was standing at the gate of one of those cozy\nlittle rose-clad cottages of the sort already\nreferred to. However, this one hadn't a deserted\nlook; it had the look of being lived in and\npetted and cared for and looked after; and so had\nits front yard, which was a garden of flowers,\nabundant, gay, and flourishing. I was invited in,\nof course, and required to make myself at home--";
testo[a++]="it was the custom of the country.. It was\ndelightful to be in such a place, after long\nweeks of daily and nightly familiarity with\nminers' cabins--with all which this implies\nof dirt floor, never-made beds, tin plates and\ncups, bacon and beans and black coffee, and\nnothing of ornament but war pictures from the\nEastern illustrated papers tacked to the\nlog walls. That was all hard, cheerless,\nmaterialistic desolation, but here was a nest\nwhich had aspects to rest the";

Not to\nmention rumours which agitated the maritime\npopulation and excited the public mind, even in\nthe interior of continents, seafaring men were\nparticularly excited. Merchants, common sailors,\ncaptains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and\nAmerica, naval officers of all countries, and the\nGovernments of several States on the two";

And that it did exist was an undeniable\nfact; and, with that tendency which disposes the\nhuman mind in favour of the marvellous, we can\nunderstand the excitement produced in the entire\nworld by this supernatural apparition. As to\nclassing it in the list of fables, the idea was\nout of the question.

Similar facts were observed\non the 23rd of July in the same year, in the\nPacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India\nand Pacific Steam Navigation Company.

After six months in Nebraska, I\narrived in New York towards the end of March,\nladen with a precious collection. My departure\nfor France was fixed for the first";

This mystery puzzled me. Under the\nimpossibility of forming an opinion, I jumped\nfrom one extreme to the other. That there really\nwas";
testo[a++]="something could not be doubted, and the\nincredulous were invited to put their finger on\nthe wound of the Scotia. On my arrival at New\nYork the question was at its height. The theory\nof the floating island, and the unapproachable\nsandbank, supported by minds little competent to\nform a judgment, was abandoned. And, indeed,\nunless this shoal had a machine in its stomach,\nhow could it change its position with such\nastonishing rapidity?";
testo[a++]="From the same cause, the idea of a floating hull\nof an enormous wreck was given up. There remained,\nthen, only two possible solutions of the question,\nwhich created two distinct parties: on one side,\nthose who were for a monster of colossal strength;\non the other, those who were for a submarine\nvessel of enormous motive power.";
testo[a++]="But this last theory, plausible as it was, could\nnot stand against inquiries made in both worlds.\nThat a private gentleman should have such a\nmachine at his command was not likely.

In his left hand was a gold snuff-box,\nfrom which, as he capered down the hill, cutting\nall manner of fantastic steps, he took snuff\nincessantly with an air of the greatest possible\nself-satisfaction. God bless me! -- here was a\nsight for the honest burghers of\nVondervotteimittiss!";
testo[a++]="To speak plainly, the fellow had, in spite of his\ngrinning, an audacious and sinister kind of face;\nand as he curvetted right into the village, the\nold stumpy appearance of his pumps excited no\nlittle suspicion; and many a burgher who beheld\nhim that day would have given a trifle for a peep\nbeneath the white cambric handkerchief which hung\nso obtrusively from the pocket of his swallow-\ntailed coat.

testo[a++]="The man Silver knew was named Klein. At three\no'clock Klein brought his Wall Street friend to\nsee us in Silver's room. \"Mr. Morgan\" looked some\nlike his pictures, and he had a Turkish towel\nwrapped around his left foot, and he walked\nwith a cane. \"Mr. Silver and Mr. Pescud,\" says\nKlein. \"It sounds superfluous,\" says he, \"to\nmention the name of the greatest financial -\"";

testo[a++]="\"Stocks! No!\" roars Mr. Morgan. \"It's that\npicture I sent an agent to Europe to buy. I just\nthought about it. He cabled me to-day that it\nain't to be found in all Italy.

My collection will never be complete\nwithout that picture.";
testo[a++]="Well, so long, gents; us financiers must keep\nearly hours.\" Mr. Morgan and Klein went away\ntogether in a cab. Me and Silver talked about how\nsimple and unsuspecting great people was; and\nSilver said what a shame it would be to try to\nrob a man like Mr. Morgan; and I said I thought\nit would be rather imprudent, myself.

It's hanging in that pawnshop, behind the\ndesk. I didn't say anything because Klein was\nthere. It's the article sure as you live. The\ngirls";

testo[a++]="\"That picture,\" says he, \"was pledged a year ago\nby an Italian gentleman. I loaned him $500 on it.\nIt is called 'Love's Idle Hour,' and it is by\nLeonardo de Vinchy.
